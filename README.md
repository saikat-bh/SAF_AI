# SAF_AI: Role of AI in SAF(Sustainable Aviation Fule)
A research topic in SAF where biotechnology and AI converge for maximum impact.

# Objective
This research focuses on identifying optimal microbial strains and production conditions using AI to improve biofuel yield, which directly addresses challenges in making SAF both cost-effective and scalable. This topic leverages biotech (understanding microbial strains and genetics) and AI (predictive modeling and optimization), making it suitable for meaningful contributions to SAF research.
 
Research Objective
 
To explore how AI can help in selecting microbial strains and optimizing the fermentation process, maximizing biofuel yields for SAF production.
